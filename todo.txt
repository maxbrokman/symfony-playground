- Took a bit longer than expected, probably because some of this is more complex than it needs to be
- Loading everything into its own objects is the style I like to work in in PHP but I am aware that for this case
there could be some performance limitations
- If you fed this a large dataset you could probably see some big performance improvements by calculating mean, min, max
etc as you stream data in. Not sure how you would do outliers in this case.
- Would extract the PerformanceSet into an interface that can be tested against different implementations before doing this
refactor, tests for lower level stuff wouldn't be so useful
